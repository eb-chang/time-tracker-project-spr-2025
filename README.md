Compile the following files:
* main.cpp
* pomodoro.cpp
* timer.cpp
* user.cpp

For executable `a.exe`:

```g++ ./main.cpp ./pomodoro.cpp ./timer.cpp ./user.cpp -o a```

Main issues:
* Menu edge cases need to be addressed
* "normal" inputs are ok.
* No way to delete a bin file record yet, delete `userdata.bin` for a fresh record
